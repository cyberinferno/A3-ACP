A3 account control panel
=========

A3 MMORPG account control panel using CodeIgniter PHP framework. Following things helped me do it

* CodeIgniter PHP framework.
* Bootstrap CSS.
* jQuery and Modernizr JavaScript frameworks.
* Twitter's example login page using Bootstrap CSS.
* Google search engine (How can I even forget it? :D )
* A3 MMORPG's icon
* A3Mania Episode 5 private server ACP website for item images which I did borrow.

Features
* Check it out yourself :-P

TODO
* Edit config files /application/config/config.php , /application/config/email.php, /js/config.js
* If you get some database error create missing tables and columns yourself (Though I will give required SQL files to execute I might have missed some)
* LOGDB tables SQL are yet to be checked in. Until then try to run by disabling log feature or figure out tables yourself

Demo
* For demo check http://acp.a3flamez.com

Guide
* Not yet done. Will do it soon.
